## Introduction

In this project, you'll explore how to add an image as a background to your HTML webpage. Whether you're a web developer or a designer, this project will teach you how to create visually appealing web pages by customizing the background with images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for web development.
- An image you want to use as the background (ensure it's appropriately sized and formatted).

## Usage

1. Create a new HTML file or open an existing one that you want to set the background image for.

2. Place your image file in the same directory as your HTML file.

3. Open the HTML file in your text editor or IDE.

4. Add the following CSS code within the `<style>` section of your HTML file or in an external CSS file (recommended):

   ```css
   body {
     background-image: url("your-image-file.jpg");
     background-size: cover;
   }
   ```

   Replace `'your-image-file.jpg'` with the filename of your image.

5. Save your HTML file.

6. Open your HTML file in a web browser, and you should see your image as the background.

You can further customize the background image by adjusting CSS properties such as `background-position`, `background-repeat`, and `background-attachment` to achieve the desired effect.
